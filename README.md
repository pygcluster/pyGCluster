pyGCluster is a clustering algorithm focusing on noise injection for subsequent cluster validation. By requesting identical cluster identity, the reproducibility of a large amount of clusters obtained with agglomerative hierarchical clustering is assessed. Furthermore, a multitude of different distance-linkage combinations are evaluated. Finally, highly reproducible clusters are grouped into communities, and graphical representation of the results as node maps and heat maps is implemented.
